# Fast coarse-graining of structure tensor 
Coarse-graining operations introduce self-correlations in image data, therefore effectively downscaling image dimensions.
Using this, a faster version of the structure tensor is implemented, where the coarse graining operation is performed on a lower dimension and later upscaled.
